# DV Project 1

This project aims at solving the mini-challenge 2 of VAST analytics challenge held in the year 2017. The problem statement given in this year revolves around a hypothetical city called Mistford which is located to the south-west of a large wildlife preserve. The city also has four factories to the south of the preserve. Mitch, an ornithology graduate student observes that the population of a particular bird, Rose-crested Blue Pipit is decreasing. He is suspicious that the factories in the area release harmful gases in the atmosphere and that might be related to the declining population of the bird. 
The state government has installed 9 sensors around the factories to monitor the gaseous effluents. We have been provided 3 months data of these 9 sensors. The aim is to analyze which  factories contribute to the effluents and which hazardous chemicals are being released into the atmosphere.

This year was quite an exciting year for me, and a lot of things kept me busy throughout the year. I traveled to several places(including six countries), quit my ~4-year-old job, got admit for Masters, and started mentoring young kids. As the year began, my primary focus was to get accepted for Masters in a university of my choice, and more or less, I managed to achieve that goal. Also, I think I have been taking better care of my health.

### Highs and Lows

#### January — March

- I decided to live by myself and moved to a 2BHK apartment.
- At the beginning of January, I finally recovered from my four months of prolonged, persistent low-grade fever. It felt good to be lively again.
- I visited a lot of temples with my parents. We covered all the major temples in Tirupati, Rameshwaram, Kanyakumari, and Madurai.

- One after the other, I got ten straight rejections from the universities that I had applied for pursuing Masters.

#### April — June

- Participated in the annual [Wikimedia](https://medium.com/u/6abe4b8ebcd8) Hackathon, Prague, and worked with folks from the Wikipedia app team to hack our way through Commons app redesign.

- Traveled to 5 countries, ie. The Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Croatia, and Turkey.

- Traveled to Coorg, Mukteshwar, and Meghalaya with office friends.

- Mentored a student for a project in [Wikimedia Commons](https://medium.com/u/c329b6eef5c6) Android app as part of Outreachy’s summer round.
- Restarted my focus on outdoor activities by beginning running and cycling regularly.
- I helped in building an AR-based [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maskaravivek.spaced) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/spaced/id1479808477) app for [Zeta](https://medium.com/u/ef370e3941f4)’s [design meetup](https://design.zeta.in/bangalore-design-meetup-2019-an-expedition-into-the-fourth-dimension-61752bb31de9). We created both the apps in less than two weeks. It was my first time making an iOS app. Also, it was my first time working on Unity and React Native.

#### October — December

- I got admit from 6 universities and finally zeroed down on Arizona State University to pursue a Masters in Computer Science.
- I started mentoring a batch of 20 underprivileged kids for [FEA India](https://feaindia.org/).
- In November, I traveled to Atlanta to attend [Wikimedia](https://medium.com/u/6abe4b8ebcd8) Technical Conference 2019. It was my first trip to the USA.

- On 27th December, I got the handover of the first flat that I ever bought. It is a 3BHK apartment in [Sobha Silicon Oasis](https://www.sobhasiliconoasis.org.in/), Bangalore.

### Takeaway

All in all, this year was a fruitful year for me both professionally and personally. I achieved a lot of targets that I had set for myself at the beginning of the year.

Next year would be a new beginning for me in a new country with a completely new environment. I would be back to being a student, and it would be interesting to see how I tackle new challenges. Also, I am committing to understanding how the body works and will make changes to my diet and daily routine to take care of it. :)

Happy New Year 2020 ❤

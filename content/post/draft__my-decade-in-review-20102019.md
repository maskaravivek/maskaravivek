Looking back at this decade, I just realized that I have graduated from being a young teenager to becoming a mature individual.

#### 2010–12

- In 2011 I completed my secondary school from Laxman Public School, New Delhi.
- I appeared for IIT and AIEEE entrance examinations in 2011, but based on the results, I didn’t get a satisfactory admit.
- I decided to drop for a year and started coaching for the entrance exams from the Resonance coaching institute in Kota. It was quite a learning experience for me as the place taught me the importance of discipline, patience, hard work, and persistence.

#### 2012–16

- In 2012, I started my BE in Manufacturing Engineering from BITS Pilani, but after a week, I realized that my heart lies in Computer Science.
- I took admission in Delhi Technological University to pursue BTech in Software Engineering. Looking back, I think it was the right decision to switch streams and going to DTU.
- In my freshmen year, I began developing apps for Windows Phone, and over the next few years, I built several apps that garnered over a million downloads.
- During my time at college, I did several internships(4 to be precise), which taught me about the various nuances of building a product.
- My 2-month [internship with Zeta](/the-internship-f8be2c9a4ca8) deserves a special mention as it taught me a lot about working in proper teams. I was offered a pre-placement offer and I gladly accepted it. :)
- I completed my graduation from Delhi Technological University in 2016.

#### 2016–19

- In June 2016, I started my first full-time job at a Bangalore based fin-tech company, Zeta.
- Towards the end of 2016, I bought my first flat in Bangalore.
- At the starting of 2017, I [began my open source journey](/how-to-get-started-with-open-source-6806749ae4c8) with the Wikimedia Foundation as a volunteer member of the Wikimedia Commons Android app team.
- In May 2017, I went to [Prague](/sparql-session-at-the-wikimedia-prague-pre-hackathon-5e7ded44fb4e) and Vienna for the Wikimedia Hackathon. It was my first international trip.
- In June 2018, I became a [GSOC mentor for the Wikimedia Commons app](/wikimedia-commons-app-gsoc-outreachy-internship-story-13e8d6eed081).
- In August 2018, I attended the Wikimania in Cape Town. It was my first trip to Africa.
- In May 2019, I attended my second Wikimedia Hackathon in Prague, and I gave a small presentation on our team’s plans for the next year.
- My friends joined me after the Hackathon, and we visited several countries in Europe(Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Croatia, and Istanbul). It was my first Euro trip with friends.
- In November 2019, I visited the USA for the first time for [the Wikimedia Technical Conference 2019](/wikimedia-technical-conference-2019-1f4763c63336).

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University. I completed my bachelor's in Software Engineering from Delhi Technological University. I love writing code, developing apps and creating websites.

As a full stack Software Engineer at Zeta, I helped in building a suite of products for digitizing office cafeterias used by ~700 corporates and attributing to 1 million+ monthly transactions. With strong Computer Science fundamentals and experience across multiple engineering verticals, I always tend to bring a unique perspective when solving business problems.

I have been associated with the Wikimedia Foundation as a volunteer for the past 3 years, contributing to their Wikimedia Commons Android app.

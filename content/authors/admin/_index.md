I recently completed my Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University. Prior to joining ASU, I worked as a full stack Software Engineer at Zeta. I helped in building a suite of products for digitizing office cafeterias used by ~700 corporates and attributing to 1 million+ monthly transactions. With strong Computer Science fundamentals and experience across multiple engineering verticals, I always tend to bring a unique perspective when solving business problems.

Before joining Zeta, I completed my bachelor's in Software Engineering from Delhi Technological University. I love writing code, developing apps and creating websites.

I was associated with the Wikimedia Foundation as a volunteer from 2016 to 2019, contributing to their Wikimedia Commons Android app.
